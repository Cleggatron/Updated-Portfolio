# My Portfolio

## Description

[Deployed here](https://cleggatron.github.io/Updated-Portfolio/)

This is my professional portfolio. As I have only recently started there are a lot of placeholder projects. These will be fleshed out with details of future projects, and I will update the order and precedence of the displayed work. 
The images are linked to the deployed projects, and there is a link to the code repositories, as well as details of the technology used below, allowing easy access to the most relevant codebases for prospective employers. 
Contact details have also been left as placholders for now, as I will finalise my professional email/telephone contact details.


## Installation
As this should just be a webpage there should not be installation required. The repo should be public for personal use/review.
